“All” developers test their solutions 

If they are seasoned (or young), they build functions that test those solutions for them 

If they are "modern" they automatically run their test functions using Continuous Integration (CI). 

We will demonstrate how everyone can move from the initial step to the last step using standard (free) tools for APL where the code is maintained in files.
